# Encryption Decryption Project

## About
This project is a simple Encryption Decryption application designed to securely transform data. The application provides functionality for both encrypting and decrypting user input based on a user-defined key, ensuring data security through a straightforward method.

## Purpose of the Project
The main objective of this project is to create an easy-to-use tool for encrypting and decrypting data. It is designed to help users understand the basic principles of data encryption and decryption, and to provide a practical tool for securing simple text data.

## Features
### Core Functionality
- **User Input**:
  - Users can enter text that they wish to encrypt or decrypt.
- **Menu Options**:
  - **Encrypt**: Encrypts the input data using a user-defined confusion key.
  - **Decrypt**: Decrypts the input data using a user-defined defusion key.
- **Re-run Option**: After each operation, users can choose to perform another encryption or decryption operation.

### Encryption and Decryption Process
- **Encryption**:
  - User inputs the text to be encrypted.
  - The user defines a confusion key.
  - The application outputs the encrypted data.
- **Decryption**:
  - User inputs the text to be decrypted.
  - The user defines a defusion key.
  - The application outputs the decrypted data.

## Instructions
### User Input
- Enter the text that you wish to encrypt or decrypt.

### Menu Options
- **Press 1 for Encrypt**:
  - Enter the confusion key.
  - The encrypted data is displayed.
- **Press 2 for Decrypt**:
  - Enter the defusion key.
  - The decrypted data is displayed.

### Re-run Option
- After each operation, the application asks if you want to run another encryption or decryption process (`y` for yes, `n` for no).

## Example Usage
- **Encrypting Data**:
  - Enter your input: `shru`
  - Press 1 for Encrypt
  - Enter your confusion key: `2`
  - Output: `ujtw`
- **Decrypting Data**:
  - Enter your input: `ujtw`
  - Press 2 for Decrypt
  - Enter your defusion key: `2`
  - Output: `shru`

## Conclusion
This simple Encryption Decryption application provides an easy way for users to secure their text data. It serves as both a practical tool and an educational example of basic encryption and decryption techniques. Users can quickly encrypt and decrypt data with user-defined keys, ensuring their information is protected.
